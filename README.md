A stylesheet for XMPP clients DOAP.

DOAP ('Description Of A Project') is a spec for describing software projects.
It was extended to include support of XEPs for XMPP clients.

This stylesheet makes DOAP files render nicely in web browsers with XSLT support.

Usage: reference the stylesheet in your DOAP xml:

    <?xml-stylesheet href="style.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>

That's it!
